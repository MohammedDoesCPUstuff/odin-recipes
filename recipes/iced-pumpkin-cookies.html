    <h2><strong>Ingredients<strong></h2>

    <h3><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>

            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>

            <li>1 cup canned pumpkin puree</li>

            <li>1 egg</li>
    
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><strong><em>Icing</em></strong></h3>
        <ul>

            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>

            <li>4 teaspoons water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
        
    <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
        <p>Whisk 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, cocoa powder, ground ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cloves, black pepper, and cayenne together in a large bowl until thoroughly mixed.</p>

    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
        <p>Cream together butter and sugar in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until pale yellow and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add molasses, vanilla, and egg. Whisk mixture until well blended. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir just until the flour disappears. Spread out a piece of plastic wrap on the counter and set dough on top. Wrap dough with plastic wrap while shaping it into a rectangle approximately 1-inch high by 4 to 5 inches wide. Refrigerate until dough is cold and firm, about 1 hour.</p>
        
    <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a Silpat mat.</p>
        
    <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
        <p>After the dough has chilled, slice across the block into 14 or 15 pieces about 3/8 inch thick. Each slice is then cut in half, and each half into 3 strips lengthwise.</p>        </p>

    <h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>
        <p>Use 3 strips of the dough to form the 6-pointed star as shown and place onto the prepared baking sheet with space in between as they spread out.</p>

    <h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for about 12 minutes if you like the cookies to be chewy, or 15 minutes for crispy cookies. Remove from the oven and wait for 5 minutes before carefully transferring cookies to a wire rack. Allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3><strong>Step 7</strong></h3>        
        <p>Mix together the powdered sugar and water until a ribbon is formed. Transfer the icing into a piping bag with a small round tip. Pipe snowflake designs onto the cooled cookies.</p>
