        <h2><strong>Ingredients<strong></h2>
    
        <h3><strong><em>One Stop Shop!</em></strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    
                <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
    
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    
                <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    
                <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
    
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    
                <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
            
        <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.</p>
    
        <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
            <p>Make cookies: Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in a medium bowl.</p>
            
        <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
            <p>Cream together sugar and butter in a mixing bowl until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pumpkin, egg, and vanilla; beat until creamy. Mix in flour mixture until combined. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets; flatten slightly.</p>
            
        <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until centers are set, 15 to 20 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</p>        
    
        <h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, make icing: Stir together confectioners' sugar, milk, butter, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Add milk as needed, to achieve drizzling consistency.</p>
