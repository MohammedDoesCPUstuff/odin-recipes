        <h2><strong>Ingredients<strong></h2>
    
        <h3><strong><em>One Stop Shop!</em></strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    
                <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
    
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    
                <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    
                <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
    
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    
                <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
            
        <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    
        <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
            <p>Beat butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</p>
            
        <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)</p>
            
        <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
            <p>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</p>        
    
        <h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>
            <p>Place 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a shallow bowl; roll hot cookies in sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.</p>
