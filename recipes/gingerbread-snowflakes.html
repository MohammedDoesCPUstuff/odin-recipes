    <p>Gingerbread Snowflakes, No Cutter, No Problem! Making Christmas cookies with my mom and aunts is one of my oldest and fondest memories. Every year around this time, I think back to that floury kitchen table, where the dough was rolled, and punched out with the classic array of holiday cookie cutters. The Santa shape was my favorite, since that one made the biggest cookie, but I also liked the stars. If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times; people love pointy food.</p>
    <p>So, as I started this production, I couldn't help but wish I'd inherited those old dinged up cutters, since I had nothing with which to make the desired snowflake shape. I know I could've easily ordered one, but thinking of all those other cutter-less kitchens out there, I decided to figure out a way to get the same shape without one, and this is what I came up with.</p>
    <p>Positioning the pieces of dough does take a few minutes, but at the end of the day, this method isn't any more time consuming than the classic method. Plus, since every snowflake is supposed to be different, the slight variations it produces really works. By the way, if you're not into the best gingerbread cookie ever, this technique would work with any cookie dough stiff enough to shape. Either way, I hope you give these snowflake cookies a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
